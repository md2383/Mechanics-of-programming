1. Which sort was faster?
    
  Typically, the Threaded was faster.
    
2. Was it what you expected?
  
  This was not what I expected. I expected the Non-Threaded to be faster when it came to smaller sizes, But the threaded seemed to be faster by just a 1000ths of seconds.
  
3. Which one did you expect to be faster and why?

  I expected the Threaded to be faster for larger data and Non-Threaded for shorter data as threaded runs multiple cores compared to just running it on one core
  
4. What could have effected the results?

  Results can be affected with hardware limitations, Synchronization or Termination issues
