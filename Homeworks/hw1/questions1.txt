1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    /home/stu14/s6$/md2383 (Student home directory, in my case it is md2383)

2. What command will display the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    ls - as a list (can use ls .. or ls ../.. to list back how many directories you want)
    tree - as a tree  (can use tree .. or tree ../.. to make a tree back how many directories you want)

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    cd (directory here, also use cd .. to go back and cd ../.. to go back how many you want )

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    mkdir - makes the directory, in this case it would be: "mkdir csci243"clear
    
5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        -Wall for all warnings
        -Wextra for extra warnings
        -Pedantic warnings that violate ISO C
    
    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        1. b is a variable that isn't used anywhere else
        2. main function only takes 0 or 2 arguments (either (void) or (int argc, char *argv[])), But in this case its just int argc.
        3. parameter int argc is not being used in the code
        4. compute has a return type of an int but doesn't return anything
        5. x doesn't have a value assigned when you do y+x. This can cause errors and not the right results
    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?
      
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    -std=c99
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    1. C - Preprocess
    2. D - Compile
    3. B - Assemble
    4. A - Link
