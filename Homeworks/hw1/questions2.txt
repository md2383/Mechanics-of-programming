8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -c -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic main.c circle.c
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc main.o circle.o -o broken
        
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        The program fails to link because in main.o, the function compute(int radius) calls the function getArea(int radius), however in the circle.o, there is a typo and the function is actually called getAreas(int radius). This is the issue with the link.
