Students:
=========================================

For this homework, you have to debug a faulty program and
fix its use of dynamic memory.

You will give your answers in a text file called fixes.txt.

There are 2 phases for this assignment, but only 1 submission.

1. Debug the sources to make the program stop crashing.

	The program crashes from the start. Fix enough of the
	problems to make it run without crashing.

	Document fixes in the text file to wrap up this phase.
	The text file entries must identify the errors fixed and the
	function(s) in which those errors were found.

2. Use valgrind to fix the memory leaks.

	To wrap this phase up, document the fixes in the text file.
	The file entires must identify the errors fixed and found.
	The file entries should describe why those errors occurred.

Then save fixes.txt and submit that file with the
source files that changed.
