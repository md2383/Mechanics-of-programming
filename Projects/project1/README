These files contain the following things:

    tm.1               the sample TM from the assignment writeup
    tm.2               a slightly modified version of tm.1

    input.1            the sample input from the assignment writeup
    input.2            a larger, multi-line test input file

    output1.1          output using tm.1 and input.1
    output1.2          output using tm.1 and input.2
    output2.1          output using tm.2 and input.1
    output2.2          output using tm.2 and input.2

To test your program, you can use commands such as these (which test your
program using "tm.1" to process "input.1"):

    ./tokenize tm.1 < input.1 > out
    diff output1.1 out
